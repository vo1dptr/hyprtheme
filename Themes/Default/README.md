<summary>Keybinds</summary>

I haven't really changed much in the default config file except for some keybinds, so once it's set up, you'll be able to use the following:

| Keybinding         | Action                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| SUPER + Q          | Execute `alacritty`              |
| SUPER + C          | Kill the active window           |
| SUPER + M          | Exit Hyprland                    |
| SUPER + E          | Execute `thunar`                 |
| SUPER + V          | Toggle floating mode             |
| SUPER + R          | Execute `wofi`                   |
| SUPER + P          | Pseudo                           |
